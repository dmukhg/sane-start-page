Sane Start Page
===

An aesthetic and productive start page to replace your factory chrome newtab
page.

Features:

* Clock
* Installed apps view
* A view of your bookmarks that can be pinned onto a particular folder. Say,
  show only the bookmarks in the folder 'Read Later'.
* A small (as yet unimplemented) todo list

The extension is not yet distributed via the chrome webstore. It will be soon,
I promise. Say within a week.

To use it in development mode. Download a copy, unzip (or simply clone) and go
to ' chrome://extensions ' in your browser, check __developer mode__ and select
this as an unpacked extension.
